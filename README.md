# Tic-Tac-Toe

Hi! Welcome to my TicTacToe game repository on GitHub. This is a simple but fun implementation of the classic game using Java. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.

The game has a user-friendly interface with the us of A.I playing as the CPU to play against each other. It also includes features such as error handling for invalid moves and the ability to restart the game at any time.
